# Twitch-Chat-Translator
This is a python script that can translate the messages in chat if they aren't in english(doesn't translate languages without special characters for example french or spanish) and send the translated messages in the chat 

Twitch Username (The Name of the account you use to translate, you can you the same account as the channel that  you are translating)

Twitch Channel (The Name of the Channel's Chat you are translating)

To get your Twitch token (DON'T SHARE IT WITH PEOPLE), visit: https://twitchapps.com/tmi/

After copying the Token right click the cmd to paste it

this is not perfect obviously because this is my first actual python code that is working or well semi-working
