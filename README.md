# Twitch-Chat-Translator

This is a python script that can translate the messages in chat if they aren't in english(doesn't translate languages without special characters for example 
french or spanish) and send the translated messages in the chat 

BEFORE YOU START YOU HAVE TO INSTALL THESE LIBRARIES: 

USE: pip install socket translate langdetect OR pip3 install socket translate langdetect 

Configuration:

Twitch Username: Provide the username of the account you're using for translation. You can use the same account as the channel you're translating.

Twitch Channel: Specify the name of the channel's chat you are translating.

Getting Your Twitch Token:

To ensure security, obtain your Twitch token from: https://twitchapps.com/tmi/. Remember, never share your token with others. After copying the token, right-click in your terminal to paste it.

This Script is not perfect obviously because this is my first actual python code that is working or well semi-working.

Your patience and feedback are appreciated as I continue to refine it.
